    <p>The field of robotics has seen significant advancements in recent years, particularly in the development of humanoid robots. One area of research that has yet to be fully explored is the design of robotic eyes. In this paper, we propose a computer-aided 3D design scheme for a robotic eye that incorporates realistic appearance, natural movements, and efficient actuation. The proposed design utilizes a tendon-driven actuation mechanism, which offers a broad range of motion capabilities. The use of the minimum number of servos for actuation, one for each agonist-antagonist pair of muscles, makes the proposed design highly efficient. Compared to existing ones in the same class, our designed robotic eye comprises aesthetic and realistic features. We evaluate the robot's performance using a vision-based controller, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed design in achieving natural movement, and efficient actuation. The experiment code, toolbox, and printable 3D sketches of our design have been open-sourced.</p>

    <p>To obtain quality pictures of a target by UAV, people face the challenge of simultaneous control for two separate items (UAV and camera). The first solution for this challenge is operating the UAV by two persons: one for control of UAV and the other for control of the camera. Due to the possibility of manual control error, this solution aggravates the situation. This paper proposes a vision based controller for target tracking that is optimized by game theory. We propose two algorithms that use backward induction and Nash equilibrium concepts in game theory. To select one of the two players for movement or to improve their decision making by considering the other players decision. The proposed algorithms are validated by simulation in MATLAB and comparison to former contributions.</p>

    <p>Robotic eyes imitate human eye appearance, but, they lack human-like movements. Also, there are no criteria to select one eye as the leader in eyes simultaneous movement. To solve these challenges, this paper proposes two algorithms to coordinate the movement of two separately controlled eyes, and, to select the leader eye in their synchronous movement. In the first algorithm—called Gazist—eyes apply the concept of bi-matrix games in noncooperative game theory to decide between their vertical and horizontal options. In the second algorithm—called Leaf—we consider game trees for sequential eye movements. Nash equilibrium for each game tree (found by backward induction) is our proposed criteria to choose the leader eye. Our algorithms are validated through experiments on a 3D printed eye robot that tracks the face for a person walking before it. To the best of our knowledge, Gazist algorithm constitutes one of the first examples of coordinated movement for robotic eyes by game theory. Also, Leaf algorithm proposes the first criteria for choosing the leader in eyes synchronous movement.</p>
